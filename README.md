# Fraudulent Reporter

👋 Hi, Welcome to Fraudulent Reporter.

## Ideology

We've developed a middleware service aimed at preventing fraud in UPI transfers. Our system empowers users to report scams immediately, and the details of the scammer are stored. If someone attempts to send money to the reported UPI ID, the transaction is halted, preventing further fraudulent activity.

### Real-Life Scam Examples

- 🕵️‍♂️ **Phishing Scam:** Users report phishing attempts on UPI IDs, mimicking official entities.

- 💸 **Fake Money Transfer Scam:** Cases where users sadly experienced scams during money transfers. Scammers used deceptive credentials, and their UPI IDs are now on record.
